## Readme for my_electron_app

Not much content to be discussed yet... app structure follows the "electron-quick-start" one:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

### To run the app just type in cmd prompt or terminal (assuming you have npm installed)
`npm start`
